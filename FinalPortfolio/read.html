        // Week 2 - Ulises Carrión - Selections from Second Thoughts.pdf<br>
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        I enjoyed reading Carrión's definition of a book, as it challenged the norm of what I know a book to be and expanded the confines which define what a book can be. The sentence "The most beautiful and perfect book in the world is a book with only blank pages" resonated the strongest for me. Moreover, his analysis of Mail Art made me question my art beyond the mediums I used, but to the support.

        // Week 3 - Martin Paul Eve - Selections from Warez The Infrastructure and Aesthetics of Piracy
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        Martin Paul Eve explores the underground subculture of piracy, an elite, worldwide, organized network of pirate groups who illegally obtain and release media before their official release date. Also known as the "Scene", Eve dissects its infrastructures into four discrete levels: topsites, IRC channels, bouncer systems, and command-and-control systems. Something I noted while reading was the vastness of the Scene's operations, which largely depended on a large community to uphold such as through cross-checking the open license source code to check for vulnerabilities. This made me wonder how many people were actually involved in the Scene, and if that could even be quantified given the secrecy and animosity of digital piracy. Although, I was unsurprised for the most part by the social culture of the Scene outlined by Eve. He described it to be mostly made of adolescent males who sustained an exclusive culture of elitism and casual homophobia, not that far from the stereotypes that define today's "tech bros."

        // Week 4 - Willa Köerner, Laurel Schwulst, & Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        Laurel's metaphors of websites as room, garden, puddle, etc. helped me best understand her message that a website can be anything. Especially for artists, it is important to not think of websites as an archive of finished works, but rather as something interactive, unfinished, living. Her ideas have inspired me to think about websites from a much different and open perspective than before. The world, the website containing my work is another form of artistic work.

        // Week 5 - Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        I had never really thought of digitally archiving prints from a company's, like Amazon's, perspective. I always thought of it as simply part of the world's general shift and adaptation to technology but I guess that money really does run the world. Google has invested immense time, money, and effort into acquiring printed materials and digitally archiving them. I definitely feel that there has been constructed the notion that the internet contains answers to every problem, when in fact it does not.

        // Week 6 - Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s)
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        I found the evolution of typefaces to adapt to the digital screen intriguing, especially all the small details outlined by Duvall I wouldn't have otherwise noticed. What I understood from his writing was the shift in focus from machine to human in typography during Postmodernism. Although, I did struggle to understand some of the jargon and references used to describe the typefaces in context of their historical origins.

        // Week 7 - Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        This workbook on alt-text made me reflect on my lack of usage of alt-text in my own code. I strongly relate to statement that “some people feel artists are not good describers of their own work”. Often times, I have felt that my written descriptions bring my art down. However, the perspectives of viewing the text as poetry and translation inspire me to integrate more text as a part of my work.

        // Week 8 - Metahaven - White Night Before A Manifesto & Seth Price - Dispersion
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        What I found intriguing about Seth Price's Dispersion is how the work itself could be a demonstration of its emphasis on distribution. I wonder if Price intentionally dispersed this work in ways that utilized the meaning-making capacity of communication networks. The PDF here appears to be a scan of a physical copy, but I wonder if Price released different formats of the work, such as digitally on the net. I also enjoyed reading Metahaven's dissections of surface symbolisms in White Night Before A Manifesto, particularly through a lense of consumerism under capitalism.

        // Week 9 - David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        Something I've come to appreciate about design, especially compared to other subjects, is the lack of universal rules that dictate what can and cannot be done. As written by design director Donis A. Dondis in their graphic design textbook, there is no way to numerically measure the "effectiveness" of a design, so every design carries its individual psychological merits on its viewers. In particular, Reinfurt's discourse portrayed graphic design as not only a technique, but an elementary way of conversing with the world.

        // Week 10 - Josh Harle, Angie Abdila, & Andrew Newman (eds) - Selections from Decolonising the Digital
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        I found reading the various examples on colonial culture's impact on the digital both enlightening and familiar. While I found myself relating to the example about the male-dominated gamer community's resistance towards women's presence in games, I had never thought that something as machine and operationalized as programming languages could be embedded with algorithmic biases and Anglocentric assumptions. Especially as one of the target audiences, whose worldviews are primarily represented through Western technology, I learned a lot about new practices of technology inclusive of Indigenous and Australian Aboriginal perspectives.

        // Week 11 - Neta Bomani & Sabii Bornologic - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons & Paul Saulellis - Performing the Feed.pdf
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        I found the idea of introducing computer software concepts through a comic character perspective from behind the interface to be novel. I especially appreciated the author’s acknowledgement of the danger of software and much of the data lost in translation. The character takes on many discoveries, good and also bad, about the computer as her awareness of the digital world increases.

        // Week 12 - Hito Steyerl - Why Games Or Can Art Workers Think & Manuel Arturo Abreu - Incalculable Loss
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        The data-mining that Abreu describes in Incalculable Loss results in the application of incalculable algorithms, enabling actions and choices through correlations and rules that should not otherwise be reached through human perception. The problem doesn't necessarily lie in the procedures themselves, but rather in the interpretations of them applied to modern society. Moreover, the computations enable us to reduce human lives to mere numbers, bits of data, a dehumanizing process.

        // Week 13 - Jasia Reichardt ed - Selections from Cybernetic Serendipity the Computer and the Arts
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        On Computer Art by Jasia Reichardt, the essay discusses the popular question of whether the computer will one day replace the artist. Reichardt affirms that the machine lacks the essence of what makes art- imagination, intuition, and emotion. I found the perspective of this essay interesting, as it was written at the very budding of computer graphics and primarily discussed the ways in which artists may utilize emerging technologies. I wonder how Reichardt would respond to AI-generated art pieces, especially as they have been emerging in prominence in recent years.

        // Week 14 - Boris Groys - Art on the Internet & Christine T. Wolfe - Computing in Crip Time from Logic Issue 16 Clouds
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        Brois Groy's discussion of "Art on the Internet" primarily deals with not digital art but how art is presented and distributed on the internet. Most notably, he points out the permanency of the internet as every piece of information and action is registered and traceable. He then asserts archives as a space to anticipate the art's future present rather than conserving its past. I also enjoyed reading Christine T. Wolfe's speculations on how her experiences with living in crip time led her to question the intense "flow" of work and life that everyone is expected to live by.

        // Week 15 - Alyssa Battistoni - A Repair Manual for Spaceship Earth from Logic Issue 9 Nature & Wendy Hui Kyong Chun - On Software or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        In "On Software or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge", Chun explains how programming languages stem from a gendered system and thus work to discipline its users. Specifically, she points to the emergence of advanced, higher-level programming during a transition from "commanding a 'girl' to commanding a machine", when female operators were replaced by automatic programming. I found it interesting that she then explores the power relationships, rather than the silenced history of women working with computers.

        // Week 16 - Donella Meadows & John Richardson & Gerhart Bruckmann - Groping in the Dark
    </p>
    <p class = "p2">
        My understanding of "A fable from the past" is that the writer is describing two different types of people in this world: people who stand in the light and people who grope in the dark. The difference between the two is their approach to solving problems. People who stand in the light are more cautious, seeking a solution while being held back by their caution. People who grope in the dark understand that there will be setbacks, but also that it's more valuable to take action than wait too long.
